## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- Added OpenCode and Pi session providers alongside Codex and Claude Code for agent search, refs, and workspace browsing. ([421652b](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/421652b44aab45bc22acb09f3ab8ea307e08f127), [d2bf657](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/d2bf657d094cdf578eb7a55f0f0eee51736c3c53))
- Added the canonical WorkRecord/WorkPart model with typed WorkRefs, including part-level refs such as `pi/<session>/<turn>/o/1`. ([d993d03](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/d993d031399a35be1b43e1fcfcb165c0dc934f13), [a3de450](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/a3de4506bac622af8958aad26447709b7e1c28da), [5abafcd](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/5abafcd49cbd01474a475cb6dc8ae4ebaca8b960), [53c6442](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/53c6442674e4f9db14156ff88ff9e4ef08a2be3b))
- Added WorkSet-based memory workflows: `search`, `show`, `zoom`, `work records`, and `work parts` now operate on reusable `records + anchors` selections with `@last`, named `@sets`, stdin `@` pipelines, `--refs`, and `--json` output. ([940712a](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/940712a39d72de73edf9dc585d811abc9de67173), [9d07972](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/9d07972cb2676d9a3b00e72ed858d7f269629463), [a931885](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/a93188546bf3218d876ab8d24ac56dc8e421ce3a))
- Added target-first search and rich filters for provider/session/record/part selectors, `--kind`, input/output/command fields, exclusion, status, exit code, duration, cwd, time ranges, sorting, and latest-result limits.

### Changed

- Search and work traversal now use WorkParts as the source of truth; input/output text is a projection over parts instead of separate duplicated payloads. ([b9d463e](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/b9d463e7f6675a2c91d027de1b07a8ef8b01fbd9), [7e39982](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/7e399826f7532aacde645c93a360a547ff6ac096), [a931885](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/a93188546bf3218d876ab8d24ac56dc8e421ce3a))
- Workspace resolution now scopes terminal and agent records by git root so subdirectories in the same repository share workspace memory. ([5980b04](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/5980b04cb7180c169a4b05b5819b8a5d9b78c570), [e61ca54](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/e61ca5432626a68103e6c6b738fd883f8a7f09ba))
- Workspace picker, copy, and search flows now route through typed work records/refs for more consistent selections and copy output. ([7f2d7a8](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/7f2d7a8565852ec01108f0ee6d488edb2a091a88), [325569f](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/325569f539535497d255aace14c788a6172b09d4), [c700233](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/c700233a3cf1c1f0a499f1c3df738e9647ee6542))
- Agent titles and snippets skip skill boilerplate and prefer the real user request. ([b01b158](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/b01b1584155222686fd3b19a822b02a15f7262e2), [701c89d](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/701c89d61bb38bb99b64c718609f91ed929dcfaa), [71d7b60](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/71d7b60948aff601cc9e57e1bec82258ca284434))
- Documentation was reorganized around local-first memory, AI sessions, refs/selectors, launchers, and common playbooks. ([697c83b](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/697c83b672050ef77ba02c2d06abca48ad38dbdc), [1af9a61](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/1af9a6193ed457fbac360fb4ccaea951a6ed8e78), [60da546](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/60da5467b9c1327ab07edde29cba5b76cb6b4f03))

### Fixed

- Fixed workspace picker leakage across repositories and made provider/session titles more resilient. ([2fd288e](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/2fd288e1cea33be412341125a41eef88fed6939a), [cd6cb16](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/cd6cb16bb666601d8f1fb4272bf0e36f248befe9), [7cb1863](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/7cb18639b478dc32a4de20c38f88ace70f20875a))
- Kept interrupted agent turns searchable. ([3515b16](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/3515b1641b8061a3cfff66d260c34a479342e932))

- Fixed legacy shell-hook migration, PowerShell hook output handling, and launcher/help inconsistencies. ([580b093](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/580b093eed1f88900511e2169eea62749b7d6472), [888fba5](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/888fba5dd4cae7062e67e2bd95c226153dab54cb), [a3dfe5e](https://github.com/Ariestar/sivtr/commit/a3dfe5e9451c31c4540dafebb1074961e666dba1))
