description: How sivtr keeps agent memory, terminal output, and transcripts under local user control.
---

`sivtr` is designed around local agent memory. Terminal output, shell session logs, history, and agent transcripts can contain secrets, private code, credentials, internal URLs, and unfinished reasoning. The default posture is to keep that data on the machine that already produced it.

## Local by default

`sivtr` reads and writes local files and databases:

- shell session logs from shell integration;
- local SQLite history for captured terminal output;
- provider-owned agent transcript files or databases;
- local config under the platform config directory.

It does not provide a hosted transcript service by default.

## Explicit export

Export is an explicit user action. For example, Codex mirrors require a destination path:

```bash
sivtr codex export --dest /srv/sivtr/root-codex
```

After export, normal file-system permissions and your sharing setup control who can read the exported tree.

## Shared mirrors should be read-only

When sharing exported sessions across local accounts, prefer read-only access for consumers:

```toml
[codex]
session_dirs = ["/srv/sivtr/root-codex/sessions"]
```

Shared/mirrored Codex trees only participate in explicit picker browsing. They do not override implicit current-session lookup.

## Clipboard is an output boundary

Copy commands place selected text on the system clipboard:

```bash
sivtr copy out
sivtr copy claude out
```

Treat clipboard contents as shared with your desktop environment and clipboard managers. Use `--print` to inspect text before copying sensitive content in risky contexts.

## History retention is configurable

Captured terminal output is saved to history when enabled:

```toml
[history]
auto_save = true
max_entries = 0
```

Set `auto_save = false` if captures should not be written automatically. Set `max_entries` to a positive number to bound retained history.

## Good operational habits

- Avoid exporting directories that include secrets unless access is controlled.
- Review copied text before pasting it into public chats, issues, hosted agents, or external AI tools.
- Use line and regex filters to copy only the necessary evidence.
- Keep shared Codex mirrors separate from the source account's live config.
- Prefer `--json` search output for tooling, but remember JSON content can still include sensitive text.
