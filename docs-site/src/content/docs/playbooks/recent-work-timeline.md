title: Build a Recent Work Timeline
description: Turn recent terminal and agent memory into an evidence-backed work timeline.
---

## The scenario

You want a summary of what you worked on recently, grounded in real evidence. The agent can reconstruct a timeline from command timestamps, validation results, agent decisions, and workspace refs.

## What you say

```text
Make a timeline of what I worked on recently.
```

## How it works

The agent searches for planning, change, and validation markers:

```bash
sivtr search "TODO|next step|decision|changed|fixed|test result|passed|failed|commit|build" --json --limit 50
```

It also inspects recent command titles:

```bash
sivtr copy cmd 1..20 --print
```

Then it assembles a timeline where each entry has a timestamp, activity title, evidence ref, and outcome.

## Example output

```text
1. 10:12 — Investigated docs build failure
   Evidence: terminal/current/4 (Astro check failing on missing page)
   Outcome: Fixed sidebar link; reran check successfully.

2. 10:43 — Reframed product docs around agent memory
   Evidence: claude/<session>/7 (discussed new positioning)
   Outcome: Docs updated; build passed.

3. 11:15 — Migrated docs-site from pnpm to Bun
   Evidence: terminal/current/9 (bun install + bun run build)
   Outcome: 57 pages built; all checks pass.
```

Each entry traces back to a specific command output or agent dialogue.
