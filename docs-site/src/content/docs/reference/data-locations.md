description: Where sivtr stores configuration, history, session logs, and provider data.
---

`sivtr` is local-first. Most data it uses is already on your machine, and generated data is written under platform config or state directories unless you explicitly export it elsewhere.

## Config file

| Platform | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\sivtr\config.toml` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/sivtr/config.toml` |
| Linux | `~/.config/sivtr/config.toml` |

If a legacy `sift/config.toml` exists and the current `sivtr` config does not, `sivtr` reads the legacy file for compatibility.

## Shell session logs

Shell integration writes per-process structured session logs.

| Shell/platform | Typical path |
| --- | --- |
| Windows PowerShell / PowerShell 7 | `%APPDATA%\sivtr\session_<pid>.log` |
| Bash / Zsh | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/sivtr/session_<pid>.log` or `~/.local/state/sivtr/session_<pid>.log` |
| Nushell | Nushell config/state area with a `sivtr` session file |

These logs power:

- `sivtr import`;
- `sivtr copy` command-block workflows;
- `sivtr diff`;
- command-block navigation in the browser.

## History database

Captured terminal output is stored in a local SQLite history database when `[history].auto_save = true`.

Use CLI commands instead of editing the database directly:

```bash
sivtr history list
sivtr history search "panic"
sivtr history show 42
```

Retention is controlled by:

```toml
[history]
max_entries = 0
```

`0` means unlimited.

## Agent provider data

`sivtr` reads provider-owned local data. It does not upload transcripts.

| Provider | Data source |
| --- | --- |
| Codex | `~/.codex/sessions` rollout JSONL files |
| Claude Code | Current transcript/session environment and local Claude transcripts |
| OpenCode | OpenCode local database |
| Pi | Pi agent session JSONL files |

Provider formats differ; `sivtr` normalizes them into sessions and dialogue units for copy, picker, search, and show workflows.

## Codex exported mirrors

`codex export` writes a copy of local Codex session files into a destination you choose:

```bash
sivtr codex export --dest /srv/sivtr/root-codex
```

The destination receives a `sessions/` tree. Another account can read it by adding:

```toml
[codex]
session_dirs = ["/srv/sivtr/root-codex/sessions"]
```

Use read-only permissions for shared mirrors when possible.

## Generated launchers

Linux shortcut generation writes:

- `~/.local/bin/sivtr-pick-codex`;
- `~/.local/share/applications/sivtr-pick-codex.desktop`.

macOS shortcut generation writes:

- `~/.local/bin/sivtr-pick-codex`;
- `~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.sivtr.pick-codex.plist`.

Windows hotkey state is stored under `sivtr`'s platform config/state area and is managed by:

```bash
sivtr hotkey status
sivtr hotkey stop
```
